      HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it’s the “code” behind every webpage – even this one. If
      you’re just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it’s a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can’t do
      anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames – but it is handy as it helps you
      structure the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

      tools easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process – but if you want to be in full control of your
      web-page, you’ll need to have some command over HTML.
